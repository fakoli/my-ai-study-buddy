## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React + TypeScript (Vite) |
| Backend | Python 3.11+ / FastAPI |
| Data Models | Pydantic v2 |
| Content | Markdown files |
| Persistence | JSON (local), SQLite/Supabase (production) |
| AI | Anvil Serving router (self-hosted, OpenAI-compatible) |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Python package manager)

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
uv sync

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings (ANVIL_ROUTER_BASE_URL, ANVIL_ROUTER_TOKEN, etc.)

# Run development server (port 8010 to match frontend proxy)
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8010
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Tailnet deployment and E2E

On `fakoli-mini`, the production-style test stack is exposed only to the
Tailscale tailnet. FastAPI and the Node host bind to loopback; Tailscale Serve
terminates HTTPS on port 4443. Existing Serve routes on ports 443, 8443, and
9120 are left unchanged.

```bash
# Build the frontend, start the loopback services, and configure Tailscale Serve
./scripts/start-tailnet.sh

# Run the full HTTPS E2E: register, login, Anvil health, text generation,
# course/module persistence, and structured flashcard generation
uv run --no-project python scripts/e2e-tailnet.py

# Stop the processes and remove only the :4443 Tailscale Serve route
./scripts/stop-tailnet.sh
```

Tailnet URL: `https://fakoli-mini.tail4378d.ts.net:4443/`

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (or `backend/` directory):

```bash
# Required
DEBUG=true
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key

# AI (Anvil Serving router - self-hosted, OpenAI-compatible)
ANVIL_ROUTER_BASE_URL=https://fakoli-dark.tail4378d.ts.net/v1
ANVIL_ROUTER_TOKEN=your-router-token
ANVIL_MODEL=llm.primary            # text generation route
ANVIL_VISION_MODEL=vision.general  # image/vision route

# Storage
STORAGE_BACKEND=json    # or sqlite, supabase
STORAGE_PATH=./data

# Optional: Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_KEY=...

# Optional: Notifications
MAILGUN_API_KEY=...
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=...
```

The router credential is server-side only. Users do not provide provider API
keys; the Settings page reports whether the shared Anvil connection is healthy.
